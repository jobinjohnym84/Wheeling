While some trade the wheel with the goal of being assigned, my goal is to avoid assignments as a short put can be more capital efficient and flexible compared to owning the stock. Since I want to avoid assignments I will roll over and over so long as I can collect a net credit.

My process calls for rolling out a week or two keeping the same strike price as soon as the stock price drops to the put strike price (ATM) and I am convinced the stock will keep dropping. If a roll to a more advantageous strike can be made and still collect a net credit then it makes logical sense to do so.

When the stock hits the strike price the put option is ATM and the premium is very rich so a roll will often bring in a large net credit. This net credit helps lower the net stock cost if assigned but also increases the overall credit to help the trade profit if the stock moves back up.

In many cases, the trade can be closed for a profit over the next weeks as the stock recovers. If not and the option stays ITM then I look to roll out another week or two when the net credit is good.

I have rolled for many months collecting credits each time and either the stock finally moves back up to collect a net profit, or if the put can no longer be rolled for a net credit Iâ€™ll let the option expire and the stock assigned to then sell covered calls. Based on the credits collected the net stock cost is usually much lower and this makes selling covered calls above that net cost much easier. The call premium collected will continue to lower the net stock cost to help reduce the break even price so the trade can be closed for a net profit.

A technique that can be used is to also sell another short put to juice returns and help the position recover faster. This means there could be another stock assignment so be sure you still believe in the stock and are ready to buy more shares if assigned. The good news is another assignment will dilute to lower the net stock cost.

With patience and time nearly any wheel position can be brought back to at least a scratch loss or a small net profit.

Earnings Reports - If a put needs to be rolled over an ER then I find it best to roll out a good 30 days past the report date as this collected a very high premium amount, plus gives the stock a long time to settle back into a new trend. If the stock moves up on the ER a net profit may be obtained quickly, but if not then the added premium will help reduce the net stock cost if assigned at the later date.

In response to a question about this not being clear I will roll a week or two at the same strike price, but if I can collect a net credit to move the strike in my favor I will do so as well.
